            Welcome to HashCube/Playzio/Tectum(“HashCube”) a personal online service operated by HashCube Software Private Limited.("HashCube") which consists of, among other things, software that you have downloaded or are about to download, any software that you have embedded on a web site or are about to embed ("HashCube Games"), any applications created by HashCube and available through social networking sites ("SNS Apps"), any software running on HashCube's servers, ("HashCube Software"), content, related documentation, information on the HashCube domain, and information made available by users to each other through the HashCube Software (collectively, the "Service"). Your privacy is important to us and, as described in this Privacy Policy, we have designed the Service to protect information about you from unauthorized disclosure to others. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and, in certain circumstances, share your personally identifying information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact us.
        </p>

        <div class=" text-left sidehead">
            <h5><b>What We Collect :</b></h5>
        </div>
        <p>
            HashCube gives you a number of options regarding what information you will give us: When you register a profile with HashCube, your profile including any information (name, address, gender) will be registered with HashCube. When you identify yourself on a HashCube site, you may identify yourself using a HashCube account. When you identify yourself on a HashCube site, you may identify yourself through a social network account in which HashCube may receive additional information about your profile. <br><br>
            In each case, we will collect and record the information you have provided. Other than names and email addresses provided at your discretion, we don't generally collect any Personally Identifying Information about our users (such as social security number, telephone number, street address, drivers license number, etc.), exception being for billing and payments where we store your billing information such as name, street address, phone number. We may offer you the opportunity to submit other information about yourself (such as gender, age, occupation, hobbies, interests, zip code, etc.), or we may be able to collect that information from social networking systems on which you have used HashCube Games or SNS Apps (in accordance with the terms of use of those systems), which would then also be covered by this Privacy Policy. <br>
            In addition to information about yourself, you may choose to share information about yourself in other content ("Content"), such as in games. Any action you perform with other players are considered public, and at your own discretion. <br><br>
            When you use an SNS App on your social network page or use an SNS App on someone else's page, we may record information regarding the use of that SNS App, and we may collect other information that is visible on your social network page in accordance with the relevant terms of use associated with that page. <br><br>
            Note that since most HashCube Software is served through SNS Apps, it is your responsibility to read and accept their Terms of Use, as well as Privacy Policy prior to continuing. <br>
            When you invite new members into your network or send messages through the Service, we collect and maintain on secure servers the information associated with those messages, including email addresses and content. <br><br>
            We may use information about you that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to newspapers and Internet sources such as blogs, instant messaging services, HashCube games and other users of HashCube, to supplement your profile. <br><br>
            HashCube may contain links to other websites. We are of course not responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by HashCube. <br><br>
            You should also be aware that most content delivered through HashCube games originates with another content provider. Such other content providers may place cookies on your browser, or otherwise gather information about you, including by asking you to provide information through the site itself. <br><br>
            Finally, in order to provide the best possible service and to allow us to make certain internal reports and make recommendations, we collect aggregate information about the use of the Service, including information about users accessing the HashCube site or playing HashCube games or using SNS Apps on other sites, such as internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, other browser history, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time ("Activity Information"). <br><br>
            By using the Service, you consent to our retaining all the above-described information in anonymous form as long as HashCube sees fit.
